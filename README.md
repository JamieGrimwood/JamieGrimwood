# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Jamie.

I'm a developer and a student who like to play with APIs, and develop useful or entertaining websites, games, client areas, progressive web applications (softwares), and other stuff.

I'm currently a backend developer. Hopefully, I will make a portfolio soon.

## ðŸ“Œ My best projects.

My best project overall has to be Music Man (https://musicman.ml). It is a discord music bot that uses Lavalink to give you the best audio a music bot can provide.

I am also making RoboPanel (https://robopanel.io) which is an open source game panel used to control things like minecraft servers, discord bots, VPSs and more.
